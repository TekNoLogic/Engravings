Ever wish you could jot down important notes about an item somewhere handy? Well
what better place than on the item! Engravings allows you to attach any text you
want to an item's tooltip.

Engravings now includes a comprehensive listing of boss drops, PvP gear, and
token rewards. More data is planned.

To add a note to an item: `/engrave [item link] This is a handy item`

To erase a note: `/engrave [item link]`
